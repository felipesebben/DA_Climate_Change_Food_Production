# Data Analysis - Climate Change and Food Production

In this data analysis, my goal was to investigate whether the ongoing changes on global temperature have affected food production in selected countries. 
In addition, levels of agricultural land per capita were also analysed to understand the importance of climate change vis a vis contemporary conflicts.
Although this is a basic analysis, one can observe that, indeed, political instability in countries such as Afghanistan, Haiti, and Nigeria, are related to environment issues.

This project was inspired on Towards Data Science's publication: [Climate Change and Food Scarcity in Developing Regions: An analysis in Python](https://towardsdatascience.com/climate-change-and-food-scarcity-in-developing-regions-an-analysis-in-python-d8ca5ec5f496)
